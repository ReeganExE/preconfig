### Linux Setup

Currently Ubuntu 20.04 with Gnome.

  * Install kinto, second key left from the spacebar didn't work so I pressed second key right from the spacebar. Seems to be working

**Workspaces**:
  * 4 Workspaces can be assigned keys in keyboard shortcuts
  * To increase workspaces install tweak tools
  * Disable workspace switcher overlay when switching workspaces: https://github.com/windsorschmidt/disable-workspace-switcher-popup
